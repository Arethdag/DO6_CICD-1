Water polo

Water polo is a team sport played in a pool that involves two teams of seven players each trying to score goals by throwing a ball into the opposing teamâ€™s net. 
Water polo is a physically demanding sport that requires a combination of strength, endurance, and swimming skills.
To participate in water polo, you will need access to a pool and appropriate clothing and gear such as a swimsuit, swim cap, and goggles. You might also need to wear a mouthguard to protect your teeth and a protective headband to prevent ear injuries.

In water polo, players swim while trying to pass the ball to their teammates and shoot at the goal. 
The game is divided into quarters, and the team with the most goals at the end of the game is declared the winner.
Water polo can be a challenging but rewarding sport, and it is a great way to improve your swimming skills and get exercise. 
If you are new to water polo, it is better to start with basic drills and skills and work your way up to more advanced techniques as you gain experience and confidence. 
It is also a good idea to take lessons from a certified coach to learn proper techniques and safety precautions.
